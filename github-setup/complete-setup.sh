## Overview
Security best practices for the midastechnical.com WordPress deployment system.

## Access Control
- GitHub repository access limited to authorized team members
- Production deployments require pull request approval
- SSH keys rotated every 90 days
- Database credentials stored securely in GitHub Secrets

## Monitoring
- Failed deployment notifications
- Security scan results
- Login attempt monitoring
- File integrity checking

## Incident Response
1. Identify security issue
2. Assess impact and severity
3. Implement immediate containment
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Investigate root cause
6. Apply permanent fix
7. Document lessons learned

## Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Monthly security updates review
- [ ] Quarterly access review
- [ ] Semi-annual penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security policy review
