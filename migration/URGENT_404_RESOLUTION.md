   - Click on "Site Tools" for midastechnical.com

3. **Get Server IP Address**:
   ```
   Look for: "Server IP Address"

   Record this IP address - you'll need it for DNS update
   ```

### **STEP 2: Verify WordPress Site Status**

1. **Check Staging URL**:
   - Look for staging URL in SiteGround Site Tools
   - Format: https://staging-XXXXXX.siteground.site
   - Verify WordPress site loads correctly

2. **Confirm WordPress Configuration**:
   - Ensure WordPress URLs are set to https://midastechnical.com
   - Verify SSL certificate is ready for the domain
   - Check that all content and products are present

### **STEP 3: Update DNS Records (CRITICAL)**

#### **Access Domain DNS Management**:
1. **Identify domain registrar**:
   ```bash
   whois midastechnical.com | grep -i registrar
   ```

2. **Login to domain registrar**:
   - Common providers: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.
   - Access DNS management section

#### **Update A Records**:

   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 192.0.78.159 (Netlify - OLD)
   
   Type: A  
   Name: @
   Value: 192.0.78.224 (Netlify - OLD)
   ```

2. **New A Record** (UPDATE TO):
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: [SiteGround IP from Step 1]
   TTL: 300 (5 minutes for fast propagation)
   ```

3. **WWW Record**:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: www
   Value: [Same SiteGround IP]
   TTL: 300
   ```

#### **Preserve Email Records** (IMPORTANT):

- Any other records not related to website hosting
```

### **STEP 4: Monitor DNS Propagation**

1. **Check propagation status**:
   - URL: https://whatsmydns.net/
   - Enter: midastechnical.com
   - Check: A record globally

2. **Command line check**:
   ```bash
   # Check from different DNS servers
   dig @8.8.8.8 midastechnical.com A
   dig @1.1.1.1 midastechnical.com A
   
   # Should return SiteGround IP address
   ```

3. **Expected timeline**:
   ```
   5 minutes: Some locations updated
   15 minutes: 50%+ propagation
   30 minutes: 80%+ propagation  
   60 minutes: 95%+ propagation
   ```

### **STEP 5: Verify WordPress Site Access**

Once DNS propagates (15-30 minutes):

1. **Test homepage**:
   ```
   https://midastechnical.com/
   Expected: WordPress homepage loads
   ```

2. **Test SSL certificate**:
   ```
   Check: Green padlock in browser
   Expected: Valid SSL certificate
   ```

3. **Test key pages**:
   ```
   https://midastechnical.com/shop/
   https://midastechnical.com/product/iphone-12-screen/
   https://midastechnical.com/cart/
   https://midastechnical.com/checkout/
